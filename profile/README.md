# ChatCue AI

> Stop scrolling through chats. Start executing tasks.

ChatCue AI transforms the chaos of constant messaging into a **clean, prioritized task list** powered by AI.

## How it Works

**Your workflow, simplified:**

- **Capture** – Messages flow in from your favorite platforms
- **Understand** – AI classifies what's actually important
- **Act** – Tasks appear in your dashboard, ready to work on
- **Track** – See progress across all your projects at a glance

Built with **OpenRouter LLMs** to understand context, detect urgency, and route work to the right project—automatically.

> "One inbox for all your work messages. No more hunting through threads."

## Why ChatCue AI

- Stop wasting time scrolling through chat history
- Never miss an important request buried in group chats
- Auto-organize work by project and priority
- Focus on what matters — building, not managing messages
